# node-project-boilerplate
This is a basic node boilerplate with babel, travisCI and coveralls integration

#How to use
-Install Node.js (npm comes with Node, but it’s often an old version)
-Update to the latest npm version (Node’s release cycle is far slower than npm’s, which is weekly)

  npm install npm@latest -g
